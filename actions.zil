"As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the Dungeon Master
materializes beside you, and says, \"Now that you have solved all the
mysteries of the Dungeon, it is time for you to assume your rightly-earned
place in the scheme of things. Long have I waited for one capable of
releasing me from my burden!\" He taps you lightly on the head with his
staff, mumbling a few well-chosen spells, and you feel yourself changing,
growing older and more stooped. For a moment there are two identical mages
standing among the treasure, then your counterpart dissolves into a
mist and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.|

For a moment you are relieved, safe in the knowledge that you have
at last completed your quest in ZORK. You begin to feel the vast powers
and lore at your command and thirst for an opportunity to use them.|
